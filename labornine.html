        <p>Hippolyta, the Queen of the Amazons, had been gifted a girdle from her father Ares. Admete, Eurystheus’ daughter, learned of this, and wanted it for herself. Eurystheus made obtaining this girdle Heracles’ ninth labor. Heracles and some friends sailed off to Themiscyra, where the Amazons lived. Hippolyta, having heard of the labors Heracles had performed, was impressed by the hero. She agreed to give him her girdle.</p>
        <p>Heracles and Hippolyta set off to have lunch together and the task was complete. Meanwhile, Hera heard of this success and was not having it. She went to the Amazons in disguise, spreading misinformation about Heracles’ intentions of abducting their queen. The Amazons confronted Heracles, riding towards the ship where he and Hippolyta ate. Heracles, thinking Hippolyta had set him up, killed her, taking the girdle and sailing back to Tiryns.</p>
