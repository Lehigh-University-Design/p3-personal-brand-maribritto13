        <p>The Stymphalian birds were large beasts that ate humans. Their beaks were made of bronze and their wings held metallic feathers that could be launched against their prey. To top it off, their feces were also poisonous. They belonged to Ares, the god of war, and lived in the area surrounding lake Stymphalia. The birds destroyed the area and towns around it. Heracles was sent to slay these birds.</p>
        <p>He was unable to go deep into the swamp, since he would drown. Athena aided the hero by giving him a rattle. The sound scared the birds, making them flee from their hidden nests. With the birds flying in the sky, Heracles had an easy target, and shot the birds with his poisonous arrows. He was able to get most of them with only a few exceptions, and those birds went to wreak havoc in other territories.</p>
