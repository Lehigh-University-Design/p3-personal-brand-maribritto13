        <p>To steal the cattle of Geryon, Heracles had to cross the desert of Libya. Becoming frustrated with the heat, he shot an arrow at the sun. Helios, the god of the sun decided to help the hero by offering him his own golden chariot. After an overnight ride to Erytheia, Heracles found his first obstacle. Orthrus was the brother of Cerberus, the three-headed dog that guarded the Underworld. Heracles killed Orthrus with one blow of his club. Heracles was then able to shoot an arrow and pierce Geryonâ€™s forehead, causing his death.</p>
        <p>Heracles took the path over Aventine Hill, where Rome was later built. Hera sent obstacles to scatter the animals. She even caused a flood, raising the level of the river and impeding the hero from crossing. Heracles problem-solved by piling stones into the river, and bridged two riverbanks. He reached Tiryns and completed his labor. However, Eurystheus told Heracles that two of the labors were invalid: the hydra (which he had help in slaying) and the stables (for which he accepted payment).  Therefore, Eurystheus gave him two more labors.</p>
