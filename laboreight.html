        <p>The Mares of Diomedes were terrifying animals, trained to consume human flesh. They were owned by King Diomedes, who ruled Thrace. Legend says that due to their distinct diet, the horses were mad and uncontrollable. It is said they even breathed fire. Heracles took many young men with him in order to complete this labor. After capturing the mares, the men were chased by Diomedes and his army. Heracles managed to fight off Diomedes.</p>
        <p>However, the companion that had been keeping an eye on the mares was eaten by them. Angered to a point of violence, Heracles fed Diomedes to his horses, and eventually founded the city Abdera, in honor of his friend Abderus who passed. After feeding Diomedes to the horses, Heracles bound their mouths shut and brought them to Eurystheus. Eurystheus dispersed the horses to either roam free in their fed, calm state, or sacrificed them to Hera.</p>
