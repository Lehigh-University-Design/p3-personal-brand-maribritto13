        <p>The Erymanthian Boar lived on Mount Erymanthos, a mountain dedicated to Artemis. On his way to the mountain, Heracles decided to pay his friend, the centaur Pholus, a visit. They had a nice meal, and Pholus opened a bottle of wine. The wine lured the other centaurs to the home. Without knowing they were supposed to water the wine down before consuming it, the drunk centaurs attacked Heracles. The hero shot them down with his poisonous arrows.</p>
        <p>The myth says the god Chiron was mistakenly hit by one of the arrows. Chiron told Heracles how to capture the Boar, advising him that it would be easiest to lure the beast into thick snow. Following Chironâ€™s advice, the hero captured the beast and returned to Eurystheus. Upon seeing how frightened the Boar was, Eurystheus hid himself and told Heracles to get rid of the creature.</p>
