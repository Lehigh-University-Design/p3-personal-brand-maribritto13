        <p>The Nemean lion roamed in the region of Nemea, holding women hostage and luring men to save them. When someone would enter the lion’s den in hopes of releasing the woman, she would turn into the lion and devour the warrior. When Heracles arrived in Nemea, a boy asked him to kill the lion as a sacrifice to Zeus. If Heracles didn’t, the boy himself would be the sacrifice.</p>
        <p>Heracles eventually found the lion roaming, shooting it with his arrows and quickly realizing the lion had impenetrable skin. Heracles followed the lion and to its den, blocked one of two entrances to the cave, and went in through the other. Heracles found the lion, hit it with his club, and strangled it with his bare hands. After killing the beast, Heracles, aided by Athena, skinned the lion and wore its skin into the city.</p>
