    <div class="intro">
        <p>Zeus, god of the sky and ruler of Olympus, was married to Hera. However, he desired the beautiful Alcmene, princess of Mycenae, who was married to Amphitryon. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="info">
        <p>One day, while Amphitryon was traveling, Zeus disguised himself as him and slept with Alcmene. Upon Amphitryon’s return, Zeus snuck away. After a romantic night with her husband, Alcmene noticed discrepancies between the stories that the disguised Zeus had told her, and the ones her real husband did. </p>
        <p>Confused and curious, the couple visited an oracle. The oracle revealed to Amphitryon and Alcmene that the princess was pregnant with twins. Plot twist: one of the babies was Zeus’ child, and the other was Amphitryon’s. Despite it all, the couple was very happy. But on Olympus, Zeus’ wife was not pleased. </p>

    <h3>HERA'S WRATH</h3>

    <img src="images/birth.svg" class="birth">

    <div class="intro">
        <p>Hera, the protector of women, and the goddess of marriage and childbirth, was known for punishing Zeus’ infidelity.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info">
        <p>The Queen of Olympus promised to torment the child for the duration of his life. Alcmene’s labor was painful and lasted for days, and Hera planned to let Alcmene and her babies die. Hera’s daughter, Eileithyia, was the goddess of childbirth.</p>
        <p>Hera made her sit outside the delivery room with her legs crossed, in order to sabotage the birth of the twins. Nevertheless, the goddess of childbirth’s scheme did not work, and Alcides and Iphicles were born as two healthy baby boys. Hera, once again, was not happy.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>A HERO IS BORN</h3>

    <img src="images/babysnake.svg" class="babysnake">

    <div class="intro">
        <p>Hera was furious, and devised another plan. She sent 2 snakes to the family’s home, planning to kill the babies while they slept.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info">
        <p>Not knowing which twin was Zeus’ son, Hera instructed the snakes to poison them both. When the parents were warned by a servant and rushed to see their sons, they found an incredible sight: Iphicles was crying in his cradle, but his brother Alcides was happily gurgling. Alcides held the 2 snakes in his fists, strangling and playing with them.</p>
        <p>This eliminated any doubt of which one was Zeus’ son. Worried about their children, the couple sought a prophet for help. Tiresias, the blind prophet, informed them that Alcides would suffer torment from Hera for his entire life, but would also gain great fame and kill monsters. And so, Alcides’ name was changed to Heracles: “The glory of Hera”.</p>
