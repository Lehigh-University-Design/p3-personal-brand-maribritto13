        <p>King Augeas of Elis had plenty of healthy and immortal cattle in his stables.  The stables of Augeas had not been cleaned in 30 years, and the feces of the cattle remained there. Eurystheus asked Heracles to clean the stables in one singular day. Upon reaching Aegeas’ court, Heracles asked for one tenth of the cattle if he completed the task, and the king agreed. Through diverting the rivers Alpheus and Peneus to pass into and out of the stables, Heracles managed to wash the stables out.</p>
        <p>However, the king then refused to honor his share of the deal. The hero took the king to court, and won the claim with the support of the king’s son, Phyleus. However, the pair were banished by Augeas before the ruling. Heracles furiously went back to Elis and slaughtered King Augeas, handing the throne to Phyleus. This is the claimed start to the Olympic Games. Even though Heracles successfully completed his mission, Eurystheus did not count it, saying the rivers had done the work and that the hero had received payment.</p>
