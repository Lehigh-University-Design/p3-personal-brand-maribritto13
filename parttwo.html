    <div class="intro">
        <p>Heracles had become the strongest, tallest, and fastest man in the world by 18. The gods and goddesses supported him by gifting him luxurious presents, to equip him for challenges and adventures.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info">
        <p>He was gifted a horses from Poseidon (the god of the sea, storms, and horses), a robe from Athena (the goddess of wisdom and war), a bow and arrow from Apollo (the god of the sun, archery, and music), a sword from Hermes (the god of trade, communication, and trickery) and a pure gold breastplate from Hephaestus (the god of artisans and blacksmiths).</p>
        <p>After defeating the Lion of Cithaeron (who had been causing destruction in the city), Heracles became the hero and protector of Thebes. Heracles was awarded by the King of Thebes for his heroic acts, by being given the king’s daughter’s hand in marriage. Megara and Heracles had a son and a daughter and lived a beautiful life. He was a great father and husband, and would one day take over the throne of Thebes.</p>

    <h3>A TRAGIC END</h3>

    <img src="images/madness.svg" class="madness">

    <div class="intro">
        <p>Meanwhile, Hera was infuriated by the successful and happy life Heracles was leading, so she devised a new plan. Hera sent Heracles into a rage that made him mad.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info">
        <p>The spell Hera put on the hero made him believe his family were monsters who posed a threat. Heracles’ ill and psychotic state drove him to murder his wife and 2 children, thinking he was protecting his family. As the madness subsided, Heracles realized what he’d done, and fell into a depression. Hera’s cruel trick took Heracles from hero to zero. He became an outcast, his reputation became tarnished and he was alone.</p>
        <p>He wanted to die and reunite with his family in the Underworld, but not before he faced a punishment for what he had done. Heracles left Thebes and sought out the Oracle of Delphi. Under a spell by Hera, she told Heracles that in order to make up for his terrible crime, he had to serve the King Eurystheus for 10 years and do everything he was told.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>A NEW FATE</h3>

    <img src="images/oracle.svg" class="oracle">

    <div class="intro">
        <p>Heracles set off to Tiryns to meet King Eurystheus, who was actually his cousin. Eurytheus was a deceitful and cunning man.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info">
        <p>Despite never having met Heracles, was resentful and jealous of his popularity and admiration. As Heracles kneeled before him, awaiting orders, Eurystheus told the hero that he would have to go through 10 tasks for 10 years to be forgiven.</p>
        <p>He was not to obtain any help or payment for what he had to do, and only after he completed all 10 would he be forgiven. Hera, of course, continued to be behind all of this. And so, the journey of the 12 Labors of Heracles began.</p>
