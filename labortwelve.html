        <p>Cerberus was the three-headed dog who guarded the Underworld. Before venturing into the Underworld, Heracles was initiated in teh Eleusinian Mysteries, so he would be taught how to travel alive from the world of the living to the realm of the dead, and then back. He went to one of the entrances to the Underworld, and was helped by Hermes and Athena. Hestia, another goddess, also helped him in negotiating with Charon, the boatman that led the souls of the dead over the river Acheron that led to the Underworld.</p>
        <p>Heracles found Hades, god of death and ruler of the Underworld. He asked Hades to let him take Cerberus to the surface. Hades agreed as long as Heracles did not use any weapons to achieve it. The hero managed to control the dog with his hands bring him back to Tiryns. Eurystheus fled in horror into his jar and asked Heracles to return the monster to the Underworld. With that, Heracles was freed from any other labors. After his adventurous journey came to an end, Heracles decided to join Jason and the Argonauts to obtain the Golden Fleece.</p>
