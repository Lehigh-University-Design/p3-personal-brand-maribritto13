        <p>The Ceryneian Hind was a sacred deer that belonged to the goddess Artemis, bearing golden antlers and bronze hooves. The creature could run faster than a flying arrow. Heracles tracked the animal down, following it for an entire year through Greece and other territories. The myth states he was able to capture the animal while it was asleep. While he traveled back, the twins Artemis and Apollo appeared to Heracles, due to Eurystheus’ command.</p>
        <p>He believed Artemis would be furious and punish Heracles for capturing her hind. Heracles explained the circumstances of his trials and asked for her forgiveness, which she granted him upon his promise of bringing the hind back. After showing the king, Heracles was told that the hind was now his. Heracles remembered his promise to Artemis and told the king to take the animal to the palace himself. As the king approached, Heracles let go of the hind, who ran back to Artemis. He confronted the king by saying he hadn’t been fast enough.</p>
