        <p>A fearsome monster living in lake Lerna was raised by Hera to kill Heracles. The Lernaean Hydra held 8 mortal heads, and 1 immortal one. The swamp was wrapped by a poisonous mist, and the snake itself had poisonous blood. Heracles shot flaming arrows to lure out the Hydra. As he fought the beast, chopping off a head, 2 more grew back. Struggling in the task, Heracles asked his nephew, Iolatus, for help.</p>
        <p>Heracles would chop off a head, and Iolaus would burn the stump with a firebrand. For the final slice of the immortal head, Heracles used a golden sword, gifted to him by the goddess Athena. Heracles dipped his sword in the poisonous blood of the dead monster before he left. Upon returning to the king, Heracles was told by Eurystheus that being helped by Iolaus made his mission not count.</p>
