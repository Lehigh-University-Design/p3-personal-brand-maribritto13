        <p>The Cretan Bull was a creature that wreaked havoc on the island of Crete. It destroyed the crops and land of the island. Upon obtaining permission from King Minos, Heracles caught the bull with his bare hands and shipped it off to Eurystheus and his court. Eurystheus hid away in a jar when he laid eyes on the creature.</p>
        <p>The king decided to sacrifice the animal to Hera. However, Hera rejected the sacrifice, which made Heraclesâ€™ success even more admirable. The creature was left to run free and eventually ended up in the area of Marathon, and becoming known as the Marathonian Bull. Later on, the bull was caught by Theseus and sacrificed to Apollo and Athena.</p>
